# Weather API Data Engineering
- For this project I collected data on relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, surface pressure, soil temperature, and soil moisture for Minas Gerais a region in Brazil. The data was collected from an external site as a weather API. After transforming this dataset into a CSV file, I performed exploratory data analysis to discover how yearly weather trends influence harvest outcomes, and also compared Minas Gerais results to other regions of Brazil.
